This repository is created to explore and understand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through hands-on implementation and experimentation. It focuses on building a strong foundation in CNN concepts by working with a classic architecture, LeNet-5, and applying it to an image classification problem using the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Inside this repository, you’ll find step-by-step implementations that cover the complete CNN workflow—from data preprocessing and model design to training, evaluation, and testing. The project explains how convolution and pooling layers extract meaningful features from images and how these features are used to make final predictions. Performance is analyzed using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices to better understand where the model performs well and where it struggles.

In addition to working with the dataset, this repository also demonstrates what happens when a trained model is tested on real-world images. This highlights important deep learning concepts such as class similarity, model limitations, and domain shift, helping bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application.

Overall, this repository is meant for learners who want to understand CNNs in a practical, intuitive way. It shows how early architectures like LeNet-5 laid the groundwork for modern computer vision models and serves as a solid learning reference for anyone getting started with deep learning and image classification.
