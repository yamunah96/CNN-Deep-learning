This repository is dedicated to understanding and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It provides a complete, hands-on walkthrough of CNN fundamentals, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and testing on both benchmark and real-world images. The project primarily focuses on a LeNet-5–based CNN architecture, one of the earliest and most influential convolutional models, trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to classify clothing items into multiple categories.
The repository contains well-structured notebooks and scripts covering key CNN concepts such as convolution, pooling, feature extraction, and classification, along with performance analysis using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices. In addition, it demonstrates practical challenges like model limitations, class confusion, and domain shift when testing with custom images, providing valuable insights into real-world deep learning behavior.

This repository is intended for learners and practitioners who want a clear, practical understanding of how CNNs work internally and how classic architectures like LeNet-5 form the foundation of modern computer vision systems. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for building and analyzing CNN-based image classification models.
